# github_auto_contributeðŸ˜±

A full, all-green GitHub contribution graph shows that you are very dedicated to programming. You are lazy but you still want a full contribution gird? I've got great news for you!

`github_auto_contribute` is a python script that automatically pushes contributions to your GitHub repository. You can get an all-green contribution graph without doing anything yourself! Cool!

## Usage

#### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chuntonggao/github_auto_contribute
```
#### Run

1. Copy `cheat.txt` and `github_auto_contribute.py` into your own git repository and commit;
2. Run the `github_auto_contribute.py` script, for example: `python github_auto_contribute.py 2019-04-01 2019-09-30`;
3. Push your repository to GitHub;
4. Check your contribute graph on your GitHub profile page.

Have lots of funðŸ˜œâ€¦
